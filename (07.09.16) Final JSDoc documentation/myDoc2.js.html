       * @param {string} [options.hash_value] - The SHA-256 hash value of the video file that should by (partially) requested from the Web server. If this hash_value property is defined, it instead of the path_to_file_on_Web_server property will be used for XHRs.

       * @param {string[][]} options.webTorrent_trackers - Array of arrays of WebTorrent tracking server URLs (strings). These WebTorrent trackers will be used to connect to other OakStreaming instances. In which order these tracking server a contacted is described in {@link http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0012.html}.

       * @param {number} [options.create_readStream_request_size = 5000000] - The size of the sequential byte range requests to the WebTorrent network. Keeping the default value is sufficient for most use cases.
