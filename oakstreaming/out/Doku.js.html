       * @param {object} [options] - Options for the creation of the Stream_Ticket object. After its creation, the Stream_Ticket object gets passed by the create_stream method as an argument to the callback function.
       * @param {string} [options.web_server_URL] - URL of a Web server that can serve the video file. If this property is not set, XML HTTP Requests (XHRs) will be send to the Web server that served the Web page. If this property is set to false (not only falsy), no Web server will be requested. The default port value is 80.
       * @param {string} [options.path_to_file_on_web_server] - This path will be used for the XML HTTP Requests (XHRs). For example, a valid path could be "/videos/aVideoFile.mp4". The default value of this property is "/" concatenated with the name of the file that is seeded.
       * @param {string} [options.hash_value] - The SHA-256 hash value of the video file that should by (partially) requested from the Web server. If this hash_value property is defined, it instead of the path_to_file_on_Web_server property will be used for XHRs.
       * @param {number} [options.download_from_server_time_range = 5] - How many seconds of video playback must be buffered in advance such that no data is requested from the Web server.
       * @param {string[]} [options.webTorrent_trackers] - Array of WebTorrent torrent tracker URLs (strings). One of these torrent trackers will be used to connect to other OakStreaming instances. The OakStreaming client will first try to connect to the torrent tracker URL at index 0 of the array, then to the URL at index 1 and so forth. If this parameter is set to false (not only falsy), the OakStreaming instance will not build up a connection to any torrent tracker. If this parameter is not set, the following URL list will be used: ["wss://tracker.webtorrent.io", "wss://tracker.openwebtorrent.com", "wss://tracker.fastcast.nz", "wss://tracker.btorrent.xyz"]
       * @param {number} [options.sequential_requests_time_range = 20] - How many seconds of video playback must be buffered in advance such that no sequential data streams are requested from the WebTorrent network and instead video fragments are requested according to the rarest-peace-first strategy.
       * @param {number} [options.size_of_sequential_requests = 5000000] - The size of the sequential byte range requests to the WebTorrent network. Keeping the default value is sufficient for most use cases.
       * @param {number} [options.peer_upload_limit_multiplier = 2] - The OakStreaming client will severely throttle the video data upload to other peers when (bytes_uploaded_to_other_peers * peer_upload_limit_multiplier + peer_upload_limit_addend >  bytes_downloaded_from_other_peers). The OakStreaming client will stop the throttling as soon as the before mentioned inequality is no longer true.
       * @param {number} [options.peer_upload_limit_addend = 3000000] - The OakStreaming client will severely throttle the video data upload to other peers when (bytes_uploaded_to_other_peers * peer_upload_limit_multiplier + peer_upload_limit_addend >  bytes_downloaded_from_other_peers). The OakStreaming client will stop the throttling as soon as the before mentioned inequality is no longer true.
